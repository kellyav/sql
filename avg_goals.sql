How does each months total goals differ from the average monthly total goals scored? *\

--Breakdown: (Subquery first)
(SELECT 
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month,
	SUM(home_goal + away_goal) AS goals
FROM match
GROUP BY month)
/* logic: first, select the sum of goals scored in each month. Month is taken from date.
Returns: two columns in a table, first is month (1-12), second is goals. *\


-- Secondmost outer (scalar) subquery:
(SELECT AVG(goals)
FROM (SELECT 
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month,
		SUM(home_goal + away_goal) AS goals
	FROM match
	GROUP BY month) ) AS avg_diff
/* this section calculates an average of the values generated in the previous table.
Returns: 2944.75, which is the average monthly goals scored. 

The entire nested subquery returns a scalar value to compare to the SUM of goals scored in each month.*\
